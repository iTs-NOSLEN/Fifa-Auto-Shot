# Fifa-Auto-Shot

This script for EA Sports FC 25 automates the green-timed shot mechanic—Normal, Finesse, and Power shots—by precisely simulating the double-press of the shoot button (Circle) with customizable timing for latency. Designed with accessibility in mind, it helps players with hand disabilities or limited motor function execute perfect shots without the need for fast, repetitive inputs. By reducing physical strain and enhancing precision, the script enables more inclusive and competitive gameplay for all users.
